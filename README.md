# CESM2_analysis
Jonah Shaw, 2020/01/28

General files for processing netcdf format from ESM output. I am creating a new repo to separate my work with
NorESM2 (NIRD/FRAM) from my work with CESM2 (Cheyenne/CISL).

Commonly used shared files are (names are self-explanatory):
functions.py
imports.py
classes.py

I am trying to move old files to 'Depreciated' in order to keep the main directory clean.

Notebooks used for developing a function or technique should be moved to 'Testbeds'.

Also trying to figure out if moving paired .py scripts to a separate folder will prevent them from staying updated with the development notebook. This doesn't seem to work right now and the files move to stay in the same directory as each other.
